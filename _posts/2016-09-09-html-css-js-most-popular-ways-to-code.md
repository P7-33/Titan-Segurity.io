I have divided this course into three parts for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will start this course from HTML where you will come to know about tags, attributes, and other kinds of stuff. After completing HTML part, we have CSS with lots of videos that would teach you CSS in very details. We have separate videos for each property that we have in CSS so that you could get most of the course. Then comes the JavaScript part, so in this section, you will learn about scripting and how we make interactivity on dynamic web pages.
