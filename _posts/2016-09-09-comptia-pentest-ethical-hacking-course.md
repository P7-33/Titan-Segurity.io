### Description:

This course provides everything you need in order to study for the CompTIA Pentest+ exam, including downloadable PDFs of every lecture to follow along with as you progress through the videos and to review before test day!  
Taught by an expert in information technology and cybersecurity with over 20 years of experience, this course is a fun way to learn what you need to know to pass the CompTIA Pentest+ exam or to better prepare yourself to serve on your organization’s cyber defense team or as an independent penetration tester.  
The CompTIA Pentest+ certification is an intermediate-level vendor-neutral certification that validates your knowledge and ability to plan/scope an assessment, understand the legal/compliance requirements, perform vulnerability scanning/penetration test, and analyze/report on your findings.  This certification was released on July 31, 2018 by CompTIA to fill a gap between the foundational-level CompTIA Security+ exam (for those with about 1 year in the field) and the advanced-level CompTIA Advanced Security Practitioner (for those with at least 5 years in the field). The CompTIA Pentest+ exam is focused on the technical, hands-on details of the cybersecurity field, including how to emulate a cyber threat, infiltrate a secure network architecture, and conduct a penetration test against your organizational networks (with permission, of course).  
This course is designed for penetration testers, IT Security analysts, vulnerability analysts and testers, network security operations personnel, or anyone who is trying to get a better understanding of the concepts involved in conducting a penetration test and its associated toolsets.
