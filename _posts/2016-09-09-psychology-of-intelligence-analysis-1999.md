People from nearly every country share information with CIA, and new individuals contact us daily. If you have information you think might interest CIA due to our foreign intelligence collection mission, there are many ways to reach us.

If you know of an **imminent threat** to a location inside the U.S., immediately contact your local law enforcement or [**FBI Field Office**](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices). For threats outside the U.S., [**contact CIA**](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/psychology-of-intelligence-analysis) or go to a U.S. Embassy or Consulate and ask for the information to be passed to a U.S. official. Please know, CIA does not engage in law enforcement.

In addition to the options below, individuals contact CIA in a variety of creative ways. The best method depends on your personal situation. We will work to protect all information you provide, including your identity, and our interactions with you will be respectful and professional. Depending on what you provide, we may offer you compensation.

### WHAT TO PROVIDE

If you feel it is safe, consider providing these details with your submission:

*   Your full name
*   Biographic details, such as a photograph of yourself, and a copy of the biographic page of your passport
*   How you got the information you want to share with CIA
*   How to contact you, including your home address and phone number

We cannot guarantee a response to every message. We reply first to messages of greater interest to us and to those with more detail. Our response will occur via a secure method.

### WAYS TO SUBMIT
