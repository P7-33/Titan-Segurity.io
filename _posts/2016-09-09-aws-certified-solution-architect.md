A cloud refers to far from IT environment that is designed for the purpose of remotely providing scalable and measured by IT resource.Metaphorically it is called, Internet which is, in essence, a network of networks providing remote access to set of decentralized IT resource.  
_Types of Cloud_: Three type of clouds Public cloud, Private Cloud and Hybrid Cloud made the path of Types of Cloud.  
_Advantages of Cloud Computing_: Perhaps the most significant cloud computing benefits in terms of IT cost savings.In Cloud computing, you can save substantial capital cost with zero in-house server storage and application requirements.You pay what is used, there is no investment in IT Capital So don’t worry about. Cloud services are extremely affordable for both large and small businesses.  
_Disadvantages of cloud computing_: The cloud service provider takes care a number of clients each day. This can lead to your business process being temporarily suspended if your internet connection is offline, you will not able to access any applications, server, data from the cloud.  
_Introduction to AWS_: AWS is a cloud service from Amazon, which provides services in the form of building blocks, these building blocks can be used to create and deploy any type of application in the cloud.  
_AWS Basic steps to follow:_ It focus follows this- Prerequisite to create AWS account, Steps to Create AWS account, Step to log into AWS account, Step to create a User in AWS IAM.  
**_Prerequisite to create AWS account:_** Follow this procedure to create an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon SNS topic, and an IAM role with attached policies.you can then use AWS CLI to specify the bucket, topic, and role for AWS config.Before you begin setting up your Amazon EMR cluster, make sure that you complete the prerequisites in this topic.  
Contents:  
Creating an Amazon S3 bucket  
Creating an Amazon SNS topic  
Creating an IAM role  
**Steps to Create AWS account:** When you sign up Amazon Web Services, your AWS account is automatically signed up for all services in AWS, including Amazon Polly. You are charged only for the services you used.  
With Amazon Polly, you pay only for the resources you use. If you are a new AWS customer, you can get started with Amazon Polly for free. For more information see Amazon Free Usage Tier.  
**To create AWS account follow the steps: **open Amazon.AWS link and then choose to create an AWS Account.>follow the online instructions>part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using phone keypad.  
Note your AWS account Id because you will need for the next steps.  
**Step to login to AWS account:** when you first create Amazon Web Services account, you begin with a single sign-in identify that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.

The service aims to maximize benefits of scale and to pass those benefits on to developers. This guide explains the core concepts of Amazon S3 such as buckets and objects and how to work with these resources using the Amazon S3 application programming interface.(API)  
**Amazon Glacier: ** Amazon Glacier works for storage service optimized for infrequently data or cold data.It is secure, durable, extremely low-cost cloud storage service for data archiving and long-term backup.Amazon hopes this new service will move businesses from on premises.Amazon Glacier provides three options for access to archives,  from a few minutes to several hours.  
**Amazon EC2:** Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides that secure resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make Web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain configure capacity minimal fiction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.  
**Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC): **Amazon VPC is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.The virtual networks closely resemble traditional networks that you’d operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.  
**Elastic Load Balance:** Elastic Load Balance automatically distributes the incoming application’s traffic across multiple targets such as EC2 instances. It monitors the health of registered targets and routes traffic only to the health targets. Elastic Load Balance supports three type of load balance Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers.  
**Auto Scaling: **Auto Scaling is a method used in cloud computing whereby the number of computational resources in a server farm, typically measured in the terms of the number of active servers, scales automatically based on the load on the farm.Auto Scaling monitors your application and manages capacity to maintain steady predictable and performance at the lowest cost.  
**AWS IAM:** AWS Identity and Access Management is a web service securely controlling access to AWS services. Using IAM you can create and manage AWS Users and groups and take permission to allow and deny their access to AWS resources.IAM is a feature of AWS account offered at no additional charge. You will be charged only for use of other AWS services.  
**Amazon CloudWatch:** Amazon cloudwatch is a monitoring service for AWS cloud resources and the applications you start on AWS.Using Amazon CloudWatch You can collect and track metrics, collect monitor log files, set alarm and automatically react to change your AWS resources.Amazon Cloud Watch can monitors AWS resources such as Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon DynamoDB Tables instances, Amazon RDS DB instances and as well as custom metric generated by your applications and services.Amazon provisioned system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health. You can enable this insight to react and keep your application running smoothly.  
**Amazon SNS: **Amazon Simple Notification Service is a notification service provision as a part of Amazon Web Services.It provides a low-cost infrastructure for a mass delivery of message predominantly to mobile users.It is easy to start, operate and reliably send a notification to all your endpoints at any scale.It is flexible, fully managed pub/sub messaging and mobile notification service for coordinating the delivery of push messages from the software application to subscribing endpoints or clients.  
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk is an orchestration service offered by Amazon Web services for deploying infrastructure which orchestrates AWS various services such as EC2, S3, SNS, CloudWatch, Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancer.AWS Elastic Beanstalk reduces management complexity without restricting choice or control.You simply upload your application and Elastic Beanstalk handles the deployment and capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring.  
**Amazon Relational Database service**: Amazon Relational Database Service(Amazon RDS) is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate and scale a relational database in the cloud.It provides cost efficient, resizable capacity for an Industrial standard relational database and manages common database administration tasks.  
**Amazon DynamoDB service:** Amazon DynamoDB Service is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable performance with seamless scalability.with AWS DynamoDB Service you can create a database table that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic.DynamoDB exposes a similar data model and derives its name from Dynamo, but has a different underlying implementation.  
**Why shall we learn AWS course?**  
AWS is playing the leading role of cloud computing marketing, it holds 31% share in cloud computing market. It has a more mature model of infrastructure though has a full stack of services, which compliments each other.
