### Description:

Every year, over three million resumes are submitted to the top three airlines in the USA from candidates hoping to snag a spot among their collective 288,000 employees. Globally, all the airlines in the world employ about 2.7 million people. And while the competition may be tough, there is an abundance of opportunity in this industry for those who are passionate and persistent.  
This course will take you step-by-step through the best strategies and techniques to get a job with any airline, all told by a former airline hiring manager. You’ll learn what it’s like to work for an airline, how to find the right opportunity inside an airline, how to engage and network with the airline community, how to write a stellar resume that airline hiring managers will love, and how to prepare for an airline job interview.
