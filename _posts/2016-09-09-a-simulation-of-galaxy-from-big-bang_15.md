> Since the mid-20th century, scientists have had a pretty good idea of how the Universe came to be. Cosmic expansion and the discovery of the [Cosmic Microwave Background](https://www.universetoday.com/135288/what-is-the-cosmic-microwave-background/) (CMB) lent credibility to the [Big Bang Theory](https://www.universetoday.com/54756/what-is-the-big-bang-theory/), and the accelerating rate of expansion led to theories about [Dark Energy](https://www.universetoday.com/119363/how-do-we-know-dark-energy-exists/). Still, there is much about the early Universe that scientists still don’t know, which requires that they rely on simulations on cosmic evolution.

> This has traditionally posed a bit of a problem since the limitations of computing meant that simulation could either be large scale or detailed, but not both. However, a team of scientists from Germany and the United States recently completed the [most detailed large-scale simulation](https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/research-highlights/galactic-fountains-and-carousels-order-emerging-chaos) to date. Known as [TNG50](https://www.tng-project.org/), this state-of-the-art simulation will allow researchers to study how the cosmos evolved in both detail and a large scale.
