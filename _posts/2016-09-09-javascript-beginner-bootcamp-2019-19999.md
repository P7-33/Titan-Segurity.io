### Description:

This isn’t the only JavaScript course you should ever take…but it should be your first!  
JavaScript the Basics is your one stop course to enter into the language of JavaScript. We are going to start from scratch and build up our understanding of the world’s most popular programming language together.  

View JavaScript in action with whiteboard videos optimized for viewing on your smartphone. This is truly a course that you can engage with no matter where you are. Take your JavaScript eduction on the go! With whiteboard videos you get to visualize what JavaScript does under the hood.  
You can practice JavaScript in your web browser! Take advantage of Google Chrome developer tools to put the JavaScript you have learned during our whiteboard lesson into practice with further examples and challenges. This is our JavaScript playground.  

There will be lots of quizzes on the JavaScript syntax we have just covered. The goal of this course is to move slow and allow these concepts and syntax to sink in through repetition.  
This course is also full of mini-projects that allow you to apply the JavaScript you are learning to actually building something that you can use. We focus on small to mid-sized projects aimed at the skill level of a beginner to intermediate JavaScript student.  
Learning JavaScript is like learning a language. This course won’t make a false promise of saying you will master JavaScript overnight. However, this course will immerse you into the world’s most popular programming language.
