### Description:

C# is a beautiful cross-platform language that can be used to build variety of applications. With C#, you can build mobile apps (for Windows, Android and iOS), games, web sites and desktop applications.  
Once you master fundamentals of C# and programming with .NET framework, you’ll have lots of options in front of you. You can choose to build mobile apps if you prefer, or you can change job and work as a web developer. As long as you know the fundamentals well, switching to different technology stacks is pretty easy.  
In this course, Mosh, author of several best-selling C# courses on Udemy, teaches you the fundamentals of C# programming in a clear, concise and step-by-step way. Note only that, but he’ll also teach you best practices and shortcuts to help you become a better developer.  
Every section comes with a few bite-sized video lectures and a quiz or programming exercises. These exercises are carefully chosen from academic and real-world examples to train your “programming brain”. If you want to be a successful programmer, who has many high-paid job offers and freedom to “choose”, you need to learn how to think like a programmer. And this is what you’re going to get out of these exercises. All exercises come with solutions, so you can compare your solutions with Mosh’s to find areas for improvement.  
There are plenty of free tutorials and videos that teach you C# and they are great if all you want to learn is C# constructs. But if you want to learn C# and become a better programmer with a bright future and lots of options, this is the course for you. For every topic, not only will you learn the whats, but you’ll also learn the whys, and hows. You’ll see common errors that pop up as part of developing applications with C#. Mosh explains these errors in detail, and shows you how to resolve them.
