###  DESCRIPTION:

Hi! Welcome to the Computer Graphics with Modern OpenGL and C++ course!This course is designed to be unique from most other OpenGL courses out there, because it not only teaches you the code needed to use OpenGL, but it also teaches you the THEORY behind it all! This is immensely important for any aspiring graphics or game developer, because understanding the theory behind what we do enables you to form your own graphical style!I intend to help you understand both HOW and WHY we do what we do, so you can create your own systems derived from the foundations of graphical development, pushing you further ahead of all your competitors out there.This course is designed to teach you modern OpenGL and graphics techniques without any prior knowledge of graphical theory. All you need is some C++ experience and preferably an understanding of trigonometry.  
  

### Who is the target audience?

*   People who want to learn OpenGL from scratch as well as the theory behind Computer Graphics

### Requirements

  

*   Basic understanding of C++, including the use of pointers/references
*   Mathematical background helps but is not necessary
*   Visual Studio using C++ and Windows are advised, however the code and theory are relevant to Mac/Linux systems, you just won’t be able to follow along 1-to-1 with IDE use!
