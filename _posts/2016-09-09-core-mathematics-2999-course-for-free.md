**How is the course delivered?**  
We know visually seeing a problem getting solved is the easiest and the most direct way for a student to learn so we designed the course keeping this in mind. The materials are delivered mostly through videos to make hard subject easy to comprehend. More details on certain lessons are delivered through text files to provide more explanation or examples. The course is taught in plain English, away from cloudy, complicated mathematical jargons and that is to help the student learn the material rather than getting stuck with fancy words.  

**How can I learn better?**  
There are quizzes after each section so you can test your knowledge and see how much of the material has sank in. I suggest you go through each lesson several times to better understand the content.
