### ** Description:**

 Welcome to Python Regular Expressions Course!  
In just a couple of hours, you will master regular expression language and learn internals of the regular expression engine  

You will apply your new skills with four hands-on real-world projects  
You will gain solid understanding on type of performance issues regex can run into, and techniques to address them  

As part of resources in this course, you will get a high-quality quick reference guide, an interactive tool, all the source code and downloadable slides  
**Why Learn Regular Expressions?**  
Very often, the data that we need is not readily accessible or useful.  
Data preparation and clean-up is often one of the most time-consuming activities in a software automation project.  
Instead of spending time writing code for all this, you can specify data patterns of interest and let regular expression engine do the work for you  
Regular Expression is cross-platform and you can learn the concepts once and use it in multiple programming languages and environment  
Looking forward to seeing you in the course!  
God Speed!
