**Why should you take this course?**  
  
So you saw that the course is absolutely full-packed with content. But maybe you’re still not sure if you should actually learn advanced CSS?  
  
That’s probably because CSS is so easy to get started with. In fact, most developers highly underestimate the importance and power of CSS. But nothing could be further away from the truth!  
  
CSS is what makes our design come into life. And there is so much we can do with it! Mastering advanced techniques like flexbox, CSS grid and animations, will give you an edge over many CSS developers out there who still use outdated methods.  
  
Plus, CSS can become a real nightmare when you try to master it, and when you have to maintain large projects. So having a good grasp on fundamental concepts is an absolute must for any serious front-end developer.  
  
And I packed so much content into this course, that no matter if you’re just starting out, or if you’re already an experienced front-end developer, there is definitely gonna be something for you in this course.
