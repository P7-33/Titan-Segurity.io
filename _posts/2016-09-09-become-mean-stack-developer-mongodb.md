### DESCRIPTION:

MEAN, a free, open-source, full-stack solution for MEAN applications. MEAN combines MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js into a single, full­stack solution for JavaScript development. This course introduces development techniques that capitalise on the strengths of every layer in the MEAN stack, using a simple shopping list application project that has a Backend server side Api built with Node , Express and MongoDB  and a Frontend client built with angular 6 that will exchange with  the backend Api . Data will be exchanged between a browser based client and an API  backend service .  You will learn the essential concepts of the MEAN stack .Learn how to create a component and a form for users to add new  items and also to edit items. The front end  Angular Client will display data stored from the backend service. These techniques can be reused and recombined in your own MEAN­based web applications.
