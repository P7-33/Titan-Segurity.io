###  DESCRIPTION:

Welcome to the Management Accounting Crash Course, which will provide you with 46 video lessons that span over 7 hours of content (including quizzes to help test your knowledge). Follow along as I explain the basics and fundamental concepts like cost drivers, the cost function, break-even points, journal entries, joint costing, budgets and more! Managerial Accounting is the study of internal financial information that can influence decision-making. It’s the follow up course to Financial Accounting, that can prove to be more difficult for students. We designed the course to act as a perfect supplement for those taking Managerial/Management Accounting in University or College. We’ll walk you through the theory, providing examples and questions that will keep you engaged.  
**The first part of the course will cover:**  

*   Cost Measurement and Cost Behavior
*   The Design of Cost Functions
*   Fixed Costs, Variable Costs and Mixed Costs
*   Break-Even Analysis
*   Handling Direct and Indirect Costs

**The second part will cover:**  

*   Process Costing, and Production Reports using Weighted Average and FIFO.
*   Activity-Based Costing for Overhead Costs
*   Preparing Cash Budgets
*   Variance Analysis
*   Support Departments: Direct, Step-Down and Reciprocal Method
*   And much more!
