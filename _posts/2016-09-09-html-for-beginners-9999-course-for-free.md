This course is all about HTML, and how you can easily learn HTML to code in HTML to produce websites.  
**Why this course?**  
There are lots of courses that teach you HTML…and of course we suggest you do as many as you can. However, if this is your first time, or if you are wanting to get into HTML and web development, then this is the best course for you. Why?  

*   Firstly it will be fun! Learning that is not fun is not fun…OK, I suppose that makes sense ![😉](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/1f609.svg) We want you to have fun during your learning and will not only show you what is vital – but we plan to keep it fun and interesting too.
*   Secondly, we know that not only do you want to enjoy your learning, you want it to be easy to follow and meaningful. As such we are careful to go in a step-by-step way through the content, ensuring you understand everything before we move on. And if at any stage you are lost, then we are here to help. Just drop us a message and we will get back to you.
*   Thirdly you are about to be taught – not just by one person – but by I unique father-son team. We have been working together for years on online courses (check out our programming courses and others). I (Craig) have a PhD in educational technology and have been involved in technology and teaching it for over 30 years. I will share with you the benefit of my knowledge of teaching ensuring that the teaching is engaging, professional and effective. Joshua, has worked years and has developed numerous courses on programming and video editing. Together we are going to guide you on your learning journey with Final Cut Pro.
*   Fourthly, and maybe most importantly, is the approach we use. Unlike other courses, this course is based on a special teaching approach, designed for digital-age learning, called the Activated Classroom Teaching approach. This proven approach results in more effective learning because you are more engaged. You’ll find out more about it in the start of the course.
