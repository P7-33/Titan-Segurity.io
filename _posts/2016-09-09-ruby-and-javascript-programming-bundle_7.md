### DESCRIPTION:

In this course we’ll learn the Ruby programming language and the Javascript programming language from an absolute Beginner level all the way to Advanced in no time at all!This course is aimed at the absolute beginner, you don’t need any coding experience at all!We’ll start out by  downloading and installing the Sublime Text Editor – for free. This will give you all the tools you need to start writing and running Javascript code. For Ruby, we’ll use a free online development environment so that we can learn web development concepts.  
Then, we’ll dive into very basic computer science concepts. Things like:  

*   String Manipulation
*   Printing to the Screen
*   Simple Math
*   Variables
*   Data Types (lists, tuples, dictionaries and more)
*   Assignment Operators
*   Comparison Operators

After that, we’ll move into more intermediate topics like:  

*   While Loops
*   For Loops
*   Conditional If/Else Statements
*   Fizzbuzz

Finally we’ll finish up with more advanced topics like:  

*   Modules
*   Functions
*   Classes
*   And More…

We’ll learn all of those things for both Ruby and Javascript. We’ll start with Javascript, and then move over to Ruby in the second half of the course.  
Ruby and Javascript are two of the greatest programming languages to learn, and learning has never been this easy!  
I’ll see you on the inside!
