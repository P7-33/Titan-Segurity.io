#### Description:

This course will give you ability to solve problems, most people focus on programming language, but people offten forget about algorithms.Algorithms are definetly more important than programming language, you can learn programming language in about week, but problem solving ability is much harder to learn. But the benefits are worth it.When you get to interview mostly they care about your problem solving abilities.To get your dream job, you need to know how to solve whatever problem they have. In this course you will learn how to do that.Also I belive that nobody have time for long and booring lectures, so in this class I try to explain the important things in a fast and engaging way, so I won’t bore you to death.We start off with Sorting algorithms, I explain each algorithm and then I show you implementation.After that we take a look at Data Structures, I chosed In my opinion the best Structures for you to learn the important concepts.As a bonus I go through complex problem solving techniques. And I show you how these works on common examples such as Knapsack and Minimum spanning tree.I belive that  learning and understanding these concepts will help you solve problems more efficiently.  

#### Who is the target audience?

*   Anyone who wants to improve their Problem Solving skills

#### Requirements

*   Basic knowledge of programming (conditions, loops, variables)
*   Some Java IDE
