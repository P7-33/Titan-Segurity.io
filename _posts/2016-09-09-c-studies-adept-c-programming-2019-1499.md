### Description:

Welcome to your Adept course on C# Programming with Visual Studio!  
My name is Matthew. I am an experienced programmer, having received several accommodations on programming in my formal education as well as tough several programming languages to thousands of students. My goal is to provide you, the budding programmer, the the knowledge you need on programming in an easy and fun manner. In this course I do just that and with one of the most useful IDEs coupled with the C# programming language.  
C#, a wonderfully simple programming language that has encouraged many programmers to pursue careers involving C# over any other language. Of course, it goes without saying that C# is an excellent language, but do you know what is required of you in a programming career?  
There are many skills in programming that are required in any form of the field, but what I plan to to teach you in this course is exactly what you will find on many job requirements as well as many advanced methods that will no doubt help you in the future. I speak of OOP, Object Orientated Programming, in addition I included data processing. OOP is such an important skill in the world of programming today which is why I decided to include it in this adept C# programming course.  
**What about Visual Studio?** A popular, widely used IDE that many large applications have been created in over the years. Do you know how to use it to its full potential?
