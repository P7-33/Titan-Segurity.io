You want to learn hacking with Kali Linux but you do not know where to start? Do you find the command line confusing and intimidating? If yes, this is the perfect course for you. In this Kali Linux tutorial, we start you off with the assumption that you know absolutely nothing about Linux! Starting from scratch you will build up your knowledge on how to use Kali Linux and before you know it you will become fluent with the basic tools and commands not just in Kali, but in most Linux systems.

*   Configuring and managing services
*   Managing users, groups and permissions
*   Chaining multiple commands for greater effect

​**Part 5 – Hacking Like The Bad Guys**
