Hear why this is one of the TOP-RATED Excel courses on Udemy:  
“One of the best courses I’ve ever taken. You can see through his videos how passionate he is about Excel. Thanks for this awesome course, count me in for the next ones!”  
\-Julio Garcia  
“I have just completed the course and can honestly say that this is the best course I have taken in my life so far. Chris has a real gift of explaining the more difficult Excel functions and making them accessible and understandable. I thought I already knew Excel well but I have learnt so much throughout each section of the course and have already put a lot of it into practice at work. The homework exercises were really beneficial and made sure that each section was fully understood. I love Chris’s teaching style so much I have already purchased his other courses and can’t wait to get started!  
\-Jon Knights  
“Chris Dutton is an EXPERT in Excel. He makes comprehensible to the student the complex (sometimes super-complex) nature of the formulas he uses. Everything that is written at the course description, although it may seem pure marketing and publicity at first glance, is indeed true. If I could rate it higher I definitively would. THANKS Chris!”  
\-Bruno Ricardo Silva Pinho  
FULL COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
It’s time to show Excel who’s boss. Whether you’re starting from square one or aspiring to become an absolute Excel badass, you’ve come to the right place.  
This course will give you a deep understanding of the advanced formulas and functions that transform Excel from a basic spreadsheet program into a dynamic and powerful analytics tool. While most Excel courses focus on simply _what_each formula does, I teach through **hands-on, contextual examples**designed to showcase _why_these formulas are awesome and _how _they can be applied in a number of ways. I will not train you to regurgitate functions and formula syntax; I will teach you how to THINK like Excel.  
**By the end of the course you’ll be writing robust, elegant formulas and functions from scratch, allowing you to:**  
  

*   Easily build dynamic tools & Excel dashboards to filter, display and analyze your data
*   Go rogue and design your own formula-based formatting rules
*   Join datasets from multiple sources in seconds with lookup, index & match functions
*   Pull real-time data from APIs directly into Excel (weather, stock quotes, directions, etc.)
*   Manipulate dates, times, text, and arrays
*   Automate tedious and time-consuming analytics tasks using cell formulas and functions in Excel (no VBA required!)

**We’ll dive into a broad range of Excel formulas & functions, including:**  
  

*   Lookup/Reference functions
*   Statistical functions
*   Formula based formatting
*   Date & Time functions
*   Logical operators
*   Array formulas
*   Text functions
*   Powerful analytics tools and formulas like INDIRECT, HYPERLINK, WEBSERVICE & FILTERXML

What gives you the right to teach this class? Can’t I just Google this stuff?  
I have a genuine passion for Excel that most people reserve for things like kittens, ice cream, and/or significant others. The only thing I love more than learning Excel is teaching it, and as the founder of Excel Maven I’ve been lucky enough to teach tens of thousands of people just like you over the past 10+ years. My teaching style is conversational, authentic and to the point, and I will always communicate complex concepts in a framework that is clear and easy to comprehend.  
As a full-time analytics consultant and Excel instructor, I cut my teeth using Excel to solve real-world business problems and develop award-winning analytics & data visualization tools for Fortune 500 companies. If you care about creds, I’m a card-carrying MOS Certified Excel Expert and my work has been featured by Microsoft and the New York Times. Ok so I don’t actually carry the card, but you get the idea.  
If you’re looking for the ONE course with all of the advanced formulas and functions that you need to know to become an absolute Excel ninja, you’ve found it.  
See you in there!  
\-Chris (Founder, Excel Maven)
