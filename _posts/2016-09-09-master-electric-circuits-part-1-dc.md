### Description:

**Master Electric circuit** **with this invented method, step by step after this course, DC circuit will be a video games for you.**  

*   Why it’s very important to begin with DC circuits?
*   Because it’s the base off all electronics! Yes; before begin electronics this step is critical.

First we begin with basics, sign convetion, electric potential difference, junction rule, loop equation: These 5 things are one of the secrets of electric circuit, and I have some tricks for you for mastering those technics.  

After that we have two powerfull technics: Voltage divider formula and current divider formula.  
And we have also Kirchhof’s rules and Thévenin’s Theorem.  

Enjoy my course!  
So we have:  

*   Sign convention
*   Junction rule
*   Loop equation
*   Ohm’s Law
*   Current divider and voltage divider formulas-part1
*   Power consumed in a resistor
*   Impedance matching
*   Power and motor
*   Efficiency of a DC motor
*   Kirchhoff’s rules
*   Batteries in series and parallel
*   Resistors in series and parallel
*   Thevenin’s Theorem

### Who is the target audience?

*   Electrical engineer student and future electrical engineer
*   Students in physics or computer science classes
*   Passionate about electronics
*   Electronics geeks

### Requirements

*   Basic maths
*   Some analysis can help, but isn’t required
*   Some algebra like Cramer’s Rule
