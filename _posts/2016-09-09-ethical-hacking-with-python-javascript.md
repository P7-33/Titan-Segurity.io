### Description

Welcome to this most comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking. Hacking is not always a rewarding activity but it is one of the most fun profession where you can use your knowledge to make yours and others system secured. This course will try to turn you into a person who can check for the vulnerability in the system and make your own payload to pen-test that system and evaluate proper security measures that needs to be adopted. We’ll try to make payloads and test systems from section one, Thus this course is highly practical. We (Bit4Stack Tech Inc.) assumes that you have no prior knowledge in these topics, So we will provide some theory related to networking at the beginning and hands on examples with it.  
We will cover three modules in this course. Every module will have rich contents related to Hacking. First module covers about Kali Linux and its Hacking Applications. We will go through most of the applications that are available in Kali Linux like airodump-ng, mitmf, wireshark, veil framework, beef framework and lots more. Second module covers Python programming and pen testing machines with it. First of all we will learn about basics of python and we will make applications like mac changer, port scanner and crawler with python. We will have dedicated section to write malware and backdoor with python. Third module covers about JavaScript and its use in web pen-testing. We will make our own payload to find vulnerability in test and live websites. Attacks like XSS, URL redirection, HTML Injection and Host Header Injection.
