**Shodan-Eye - Tool That Collects All The Information About All Devices Directly Connected To The Internet Using The Specified Keywords That You Enter**

This tool collects all information about all devices that are directly connected to the internet with the specified keywords that you enter. This way you get a complete overview.  
The types of devices that are indexed can vary enormously: from small desktops, refrigerators to nuclear power plants and everything in between. You can find everything using "your own" specified keywords. Examples can be found in a file that is attached:  
The information obtained with this tool can be applied in many areas, a small example:

*   Network security, keep an eye on all devices in your company or at home that are confronted with internet.
*   Vulnerabilities. And so much more.

  
**Shodan**  
Is a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are [metadata](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Metadata "metadata") that the server sends back to the client.  
_**What is the difference between Google or another search engine:**_ The most fundamental difference is that [Shodan](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Shodan "Shodan") Eye crawls on the internet, Google on the World Wide Web. However, the devices that support the World Wide Web are only a small part of what is actually connected to the Internet.  
  
**Shodan**  
For additional data gathering, you can enter a [Shodan API](https://www.kitploit.com/search/label/Shodan%20API "Shodan API") key when prompted. A Shodan API key can be found here: [https://account.shodan.io/register](https://account.shodan.io/register "https://account.shodan.io/register")  
  
**A collection of search queries for Shodan is attached:**

**Python:**  
I made this script in python 2.7 (Later I can - I will change this to python 3) But for now I think python 2 is nicer, more beautiful and better. "It's kind of personal"

cd shodan-eye
