### Description:

Cryptography is essential to protect sensitive information, but it is often performed inadequately or incorrectly. Learn how to encrypt data, evaluate and compare encryption methods, and how to attack them. This video course starts by showing you how to encrypt and evaluate your data. You are also walked through various data encryption methods—such as obfuscation, hashing, and strong encryption—and how you can attack them. You will then learn how to make hashes and crack them, and understand why they are so different. You will also learn how to use three NIST-recommended systems: AES, SHA, and RSA. Towards the end of the course, you will master common errors in encryption and how to exploit them.
