### 

Did you enjoy not being in the mountains for a brief moment in Episode 7? Well guess what? We're back, baby. There might still be some tough bits, but we're definitely on the other side now, and we're heading down. Eventually. This episode has a few more preppers (well, scientists) to bring onto the network, and a few new gameplay systems to consider, but it's nothing you can't handle with some gentle guidance! If you're not quite at this chapter yet, follow the links below to our previous instalments.

**Afraid of spoilers?** Don't worry! We'll make sure these walkthroughs are as spoiler-free as possible when it comes to the main story beats. But if you're at this point in the game, some things are going to be unavoidable!

The thing to keep in mind is that a big part of Death Stranding is the flexibility of the environment and the creativity of how you want to forge a path forward. There are a whole heap of different ways to tackle each mission, and on top of that, the map you encounter might also be different to the one you see in this guide--that's thanks to the multiplayer aspect of the game, where members of the community will clear different paths and place helpful structures in different ways depending on your personal game.

That said, this walkthrough will give you a good idea about what you need to do. It can offer one viable path to success if you're at a bit of a loss, or if you just want some inspiration to get you started.

Episode 8 - Hello, Heartman!
----------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604758-ds-episode07-00001.jpg)  

### 

Welcome back to the mountains! We're leaving soon, I promise. You'll start off this episode with a lengthy cutscene involving Heartman, and when you're eventually done, you'll have two critical deliveries waiting for you at the terminal.

We're going to visit three preppers--I'm sorry, scientists, who are thankfully all quite close to each other. There'll be a couple of retrievals along the way, but nothing back-breaking. This episode definitely isn't as long as Episode 6!

Grab both sets of cargo. One set will be 8 small boxes, another will be a bomb, so prepare yourself to be \*extra\* careful. I decided to carry the bomb on my back, and put the rest in a floating carrier--you don't want the excess weight throwing you off.

I would recommend grabbing some thermal pads to help you deal with the snow, as well as a good handful of container repair sprays to repair cargo later--things are going to deteriorate very fast in this weather. Climbing gear and some Level 2 PCCs to help you continue building infrastructure and get around are no-brainers, as are power gloves and the all-terrain skeleton.

Gear up, and head southeast! First stop: The Geologist.

  

Episode 8 - Old-Fashioned Walking
---------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604759-ds-episode07-00002.jpg)  

### 

Because of the amount of cargo and gear you're carrying in this chapter, you'll definitely have to hike a little bit more because of the inability to use ziplines if you have a floating carrier. At least, that was my experience.

That said, you shouldn't forget to keep establishing your zipline network! You'll probably come back here to take care of side content at some point, so do your future self a favor!

Thankfully the first leg of the trip is pretty straightforward, a few ups and downs but there's plenty of powdery, snowy terrain around which makes it easy to manage.

I would recommend building a generator once you get to the edge of the existing chiral network coverage, and charging up all your gear before moving on (if someone hasn't already built one, that is).

  

Episode 8 - Avalanche!
----------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604760-ds-episode07-00003.jpg)  

### 

Things will start to get a bit rougher past the network coverage area--if you're trying for a straight shot, you'll have to contend with rocker, slipperier terrain, as well as avalanches in this area.

Remember--you have a bomb strapped to you, so try and play it safe by sticking to the snowy bits. It's all too easy to mash the climb button and then find yourself stumbling off and blowing yourself up.

  

Episode 8 - W-w-w-whiteout!
---------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604761-ds-episode07-00004.jpg)  

### 

Once you crest the mountain, you'll hit whiteout territory going down. Your cargo is going to get \*annihilated\* in this, so take a quick break and give 'em a spray before moving on. You'll have to do it again later for sure, but this will stop the cargo inside from getting damaged and lowering your likes. Ya gotta get them likes!

  

Episode 8 - Use That Odradek!
-----------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604762-ds-episode07-00005.jpg)  

### 

I found this area more or less straightforward aside from the whiteout, but there are a few hidden rocks and drops that you won't be able to see without scanning ahead. So, scan ahead! Put that odradek to use!

Remember to always watch your step (THERE'S A BOMB ATTACHED TO YOU), head into the shelter, spray the medicine containers, and hand them in.

  

Episode 8 - To The Paleontologist!
----------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604763-ds-episode07-00006.jpg)  

### 

Now that the chiral network is online, you'll hopefully have a bit more help in the way of player-made structures. Which is great, because the path ahead is a \*little\* trickier.

I would recommend going to the map and trying to find a path that is mostly snowy surfaces before you head out if you don't want to carry a lot of climbing gear.

Head southwest. Time to get rid of this bomb!

  

Episode 8 - Down We Go!
-----------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604764-ds-episode07-00007.jpg)  

### 

Getting down the mountain is probably the only real challenge on your way to the Paleontologist.

There's a clearly viable walking path down the side of the mountain, but hey, these climbing anchors aren't going to use themselves!

A word of warning if you do use climbing ropes, however--watch where you dismount! If you land on an uneven surface it's very easy for you to fall and set the bomb off. Try and get your feet on some thick snow if you can.

  

Episode 8 - A Short Hike
------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604765-ds-episode07-00008.jpg)  

### 

From there, it's actually a pretty pleasant and peaceful walk down. Enjoy it.

  

Episode 8 - NO MORE SNOW!
-------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604766-ds-episode07-00009.jpg)  

### 

Oh my god… is that, grass?

Head down and turn in the bomb. \*You're\* the bomb, now!

  

Episode 8 - Retrieve Those Ammonites!
-------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604767-ds-episode07-00010.jpg)  

### 

The Paleontologist will give you your next critical mission--and it's a retrieval. He'll provide you with a bunch of free gear to help you out with this task, but in my experience, all you need is a single climbing anchor.

Actually, that's a lie. He'll give you a new piece of gear--the Oxygen Mask, which will help you from fainting in the area where you need to retrieve the cargo. You'll need that.

So ditch any excess gear in the private locker for now, make sure you have a climbing anchor, an oxygen mask, and head on out.

  

Episode 8 - What A Crevice!
---------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604768-ds-episode07-00011.jpg)  

### 

The walk down to the retrieval area is a little rocky, but it'll seem like a cakewalk compared to the snow.

Do a few scans, and you'll eventually discover that everything you need is down this enormous crevice. Try and get as close as you can to where they all are.

  

Episode 8 - Here Looks Good!
----------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604769-ds-episode07-00012.jpg)  

### 

Okay! Pop that climbing anchor into the crevice (wow that sounds... wrong) and let's do this.

  

Episode 8 - Feeling A Little Gassy
----------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604770-ds-episode07-00013.jpg)  

### 

Oh, cool! There's toxic gas down here. Throw on that oxygen mask, and collect all five cargo containers. You can do it. It's really not that hard.

Head back up the climbing rope when you're done, and return to the Paleontologist to hand in.

That's it. That's the mission. You did it.

  

Episode 8 - Do The Evo Devo!
----------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604771-ds-episode07-00014.jpg)  

### 

Alright, this next retrieval is a \*little\* more challenging. You'll need to head west to a site with BTs and grab some containers for the Evo Devo Biologist, who you can head straight to after collection.

Before you head off, take some time to set up zip lines around the area now that you have chiral coverage, and grab anything you need to deal with BTs--at this point in the game, you should have plenty of tools to wipe the floor with them!

  

Episode 8 - The Tar Pits
------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604773-ds-episode07-00015.jpg)  

### 

Head down the mountain into the retrieval area which, by the way, looks spectacular. Get ready for some spooky BTs!

  

Episode 8 - Let's Get Some Tar Extraction… Things
-------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604775-ds-episode07-00016.jpg)  

### 

I recommend your first stop being the large structure poking out of the ground. It's the trickiest part to get in and out of, and the ones strewn elsewhere will be on the way to the next destination anyway.

  

Episode 8 - Snip!
-----------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604776-ds-episode07-00017.jpg)  

### 

Hey, have you been using that cutter thing that Mama gave you a few episodes ago? It's part of the reason why you should probably feel like a BT-killing powerhouse at this point in the game.

So long as you crouch walk at a measured pace, you should see the prompt to cut a BT's umbilical cord and essentially stealth-kill them even before they have a chance to hear you and start to chase.

I love doing this! They drop a good amount of chiral crystals too, so stock up!

If you're hesitant about getting this close, you can still do the ol' "stand still, scan, and use a hematic grenade or shoot them with hematic bullets" strategy too.

But don't let a few BTs scare you from taking a particular path! There'll be one around each piece of cargo you need to pick up, but just puff up your chest and take em out! You're SAM PORTER BRIDGES for crying out loud!

  

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604777-ds-episode07-00018.jpg)  

### 

Once you're done collecting the cargo and killing all those BTs (do you feel \*empowered\* now? I knew you could do it!) head up north to the Evo Devo biologist.

On your way, you'll find a hot spring to restore your stamina (check out the screenshot, it's where my player arrow is). Take the time to relax as well as spray your cargo, it'll likely have been rained on quite a bit!

  

Episode 8 - Ahhhhhhh
--------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604778-ds-episode07-00019.jpg)  

### 

...hhhhhhhhhh!

It's easy the rest of the way. Hand those Tar things in!

  

Episode 8 - Time To Head Back To Heartman!
------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604779-ds-episode07-00020.jpg)  

### 

The next critical quest needs to be picked up from Heartman's lab, so let's head back there! There's a convenient, optional timed delivery you can grab from the Evo Devo biologist if you intend to go straight back to Heartman. And I mean, why not? Dude needs his… \*checks notes\* live fish?

Brings some PCCs for ziplines and some climbing anchors if you're out.

  

Episode 8 - Up And Over
-----------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604780-ds-episode07-00021.jpg)  

### 

If you want to head back to Heartman in a more or less straight line, just be aware that you'll probably need a few ladders to tackle the sheer cliff faces, and then some climbing anchors to get back down the other side.

HOWEVER, don't forget to get PCCs and keep setting ziplines! If you're lucky, now that you've activated the chiral network over this entire region, you might be able to link up to one you (or another player?) set up ahead of time!

  

Episode 8 - Whoooooooo
----------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604781-ds-episode07-00022.jpg)  

### 

....oooooooooooooooo!

(There's a pretty clear walking path through this area if you don't have a zipline)

  

Episode 8 - Look Out Down Below!
--------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604782-ds-episode07-00023.jpg)  

### 

The biggest obstacle (if you want to take a straight line back) will be a big drop just before you hit Heartman's lab. Climbing anchors will work a treat if there isn't a handy zipline to set up.

Pop into the lab, hand in the Standard Order if you happened to take it, and then head through the hallway door for another lengthy cutscene.

  

Episode 8 - Chiral Relay, Here I Come!
--------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604783-ds-episode07-00024.jpg)  

### 

FOLKS, we're gonna do it! We're going to make it completely across America soon! Your next mission will be to deliver a bunch of materials to the Chiral Relay, which will be our last stop before we hit the infamous Edge Knot city! I'm so excited!

  

Episode 8 - A Whole Lotta Cargo
-------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604784-ds-episode07-00025.jpg)  

### 

The catch is, you're gonna need to lug a \*whole\* lotta cargo, so you unfortunately can't rely on your ziplines here. It's a good thing floating carriers are our friends!

Head back to the Evo Devo Biologist's place.

  

Episode 8 - The Long Road
-------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604785-ds-episode07-00026.jpg)  

### 

This trek is going to be a little long, especially on foot, but to be honest, it's not particularly challenging, especially compared to some of the trials that you faced on the mountains in previous chapters. You might encounter a BT territory or two, but as we established earlier, you're a BT killing machine now!

  

Episode 8 - A Quick Pit Stop
----------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604786-ds-episode07-00027.jpg)  

### 

Once you get to the Evo Devo Biologist's place, you should take advantage of the pit-stop recharge your batteries and lighten your load (if you picked up any standard orders or lost cargo)

If you're lucky like me, you might have access to a vehicle someone else left behind. Definitely take it--the road ahead is incredibly vehicle-friendly.

If you don't have access to a truck here, don't worry. Being vehicle-friendly means it's \*incredibly\* human-friendly. Just make sure your boots still have some life in them, and take the chance to switch back to a speed skeleton instead of an all-terrain one--we're finally saying bye-bye to snow.

It's literally all downhill from here! (You might come across some MULEs, but it's super easy to avoid their territory if you hang right)

  

Episode 8 - I Wonder What The Cross Symbolises?
-----------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604787-ds-episode07-00028.jpg)  

### 

Once you get further down the mountain, you'll be treated to this spectacular view and be able to see your destination in the distance. Not long now! Head for that cross!

  

Episode 8 - Turn It In!
-----------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604788-ds-episode07-00029.jpg)  

### 

The terminal you need to activate is actually on top of the structure, not in or underneath it. Deliver the repair materials, and connect this wasteland onto the chiral network.

Holy crap, we're so close to the West Coast! We've come so far!

  

Episode 8 - One Last Hurdle
---------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604789-ds-episode07-00030.jpg)  

### 

The last thing we have to do in this chapter is "Cross the tar belt", that is, cross the seemingly endless ocean of thick, menacing tar.

Hmmm, okay. How the hell are we going to do that?

  

Episode 8 - One Step Closer
---------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604793-ds-episode07-00031.jpg)  

### 

First, you want to get to the furthest possible point on the mainland. This is to the right of the Chiral Relay as you approached it. There will be a little peninsula that puts you a bit further afield.

Oh hey--by the way, have you been checking your emails? I think something might have just come in?

  

Episode 8 - BTs Everywhere! But That Might Be Good?
---------------------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604791-ds-episode07-00032.jpg)  

### 

Oh yikes, there are so many BTs here! Let's cut them all down! Blow em up! How are we going to get across this sea of tar with all these BTs in the way?

Wait… actually, wasn't there something about BTs in \*your emails\*?

_(Okay look, I'm going to spoil how to do this in the next slide if you haven't worked it out already)_

  

Episode 8 - How To Get Across The Tar Pit
-----------------------------------------

![](https://gamespot1.cbsistatic.com/uploads/scale_large/172/1720905/3604792-ds-episode07-00033.jpg)  

### 

\*SPOILER ALERT\*

Let the BTs take you.

I know! I've been spending all this time telling you to avoid and kill BTs, and now I'm telling you to let them \*take\* you?

But that's it. That's the solution.

When they do take you, a very obvious path will arise and you'll need to traverse it to get to the destination marker.

There'll be some pretty big enemies flying around, but don't worry about them--they don't do any damage to you. All you need to do is stay on the path (more or less, having to dip into the tar for a little bit won't kill you), and when you see your destination (and you'll know it when you see it) head towards it and you'll be treated to a long cutscene.

And that's Episode 8. A huge pat on the back for you! We \*finally\* conquered those mountains!

Well done, well done, well done.

This Death Stranding train keeps going though, and we'll be back with a walkthrough on Episode 9 in the coming days. Thank you for coming with us on this journey!
