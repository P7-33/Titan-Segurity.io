### Description

Welcome this comprehensive course on Ethical Hacking! This course assumes you have NO prior knowledge in hacking and by the end of it you’ll be able to  hack systems like black-hat hackers and secure them like security experts!  
This course is highly practical but it won’t neglect the theory, so we’ll start with ethical hacking basics and the different fields in penetration testing, installing the needed software (works on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and then we’ll dive and start hacking systems straight away. From here onwards you’ll learn everything by example, by analysing and exploiting computer systems such as networks, servers, clients, websites …..etc, so we’ll never have any boring dry theoretical lectures.  
The course is divided into a number of sections, each section covers a penetration testing / hacking field, in each of these sections you’ll first learn how the target system works, the weaknesses of this system, and how to practically exploit theses weaknesses and hack into it, not only that but you’ll also learn how to secure this system from the discussed attacks. This course will take you from a beginner to a more advanced level by the time you finish, you will have knowledge about most penetration testing fields.  
The course is divided into four main sections:  
**1. Network Hacking**_ – _This section will teach you how to test the security of networks, both wired and wireless. First, you will learn some  basic network terminology, how networks work,  and how devices communicate with each other. Then it will branch into three sub sections:  

*   Pre-connectionattacks:in this subsection you’ll learn what can you do before even connecting to a network, and even before having internet access; you’ll start by learning how to **gather information** about the networks around you, discover the devices connected to them, and how to control connections around you (ie: **deny/allow devices from connecting to networks**) even without knowing the password of the target network.
*   Gaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this subsection you will learn how to crack the key and get the password to your target network weather it uses** WEP, WPA **or even** WPA2**.
*   Post Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this subsection you will learn a number of** powerful techniques** that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, **see anything they do on the internet** (such as login information, **passwords**, visited urls, images, videos ….etc), redirect requests, **inject evil code** in loaded pages and much more! All the attacks here work against both wireless and wired networks. You will also learn how to **create a fake WiFi network,** attract users to connect to it and use all of the above techniques against the connected clients.

**2. Gaining Access**_ – _In this section you will learn two main approaches to **gain full control or hack computer systems**:  

*   Server Side Attacks_:  _In this subsection you will learn how to **gain full access** to computer systems **without the need for user interaction**. You will learn how to gather useful information about a target computer system such as its operating system, open ports, installed services, then you’ll learn how to use this information to **discover weaknesses and vulnerabilities**and **exploit** them to gain full control over the target. Finally you will learn how to generate different types of **reports** for your discoveries.
*   Client Side Attacks_ – _If the target system does not contain any weaknesses then the only way to gain access to it is by interacting with the users, in this subsection you’ll learn how to get the target user to install a backdoor on their system without even realising, this is done by **hijacking updates**or **backdoornig downloadeds** on the fly. Not only that but you’ll also learn how to **create trojans** by backdooring normal files (such as an image or a pdf) and use **social engineering** to deliver this trojan to the target, to do this you’ll learn how to spoof emails so they appear as if they’re sent from the target’s friend, boss or any email account they’re likely to interact with.

**3. Post Exploitation**_ – _In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised so far. You’ll learn how to** access the file system **(read/write/upload/execute), **maintain your access**, **spy** on the target and even use the target computer as a **pivot **to hack other computer systems.  
**4. Website / Web Application Hacking**_ – _In this section you will learn **how websites work**, how to **gather information** about a target website (such as website owner, server location, used technologies ….etc) and how to **discover **and** exploit **the following dangerous **vulnerabilities** to hack into websites:  

*   File Upload.
*   Code Execution.
*   Local File Inclusion.
*   Remote File Inclusion.
*   SQL Injection.
*   Cross Site Scripting (XSS).

At the end of each section you will learn how to **detect, prevent and secure **your system and yourself from the discussed attacks.  
All the techniques in this course are **practical** and work against real systems, you’ll understand the whole mechanism of each technique first, then you’ll learn how to use it to hack into the target system, so by the end of the course you’ll be able to modify the these techniques to launch more powerful attacks, and adopt them to different situations and different scenarios.  
With this course you’ll get **24/7 support**, so if you have any questions you can post them in the Q&A section and we’ll respond to you within 15 hours.  
_NOTE: This course is created for educational purposes only and all the attacks are launched in my own lab or against devices that I have permission to test. _  
_NOTE: This course is totally a product of Zaid Sabih and no other organisation is associated with it or a certification exam. Although, you will receive a Course Completion Certification from Udemy, apart from that NO OTHER ORGANISATION IS INVOLVED._
